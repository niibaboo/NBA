Orange Line — NBA Player Props Predictor (Rebounds, Assists, RA)
Same architecture as Blitz IQ (NFL) and the rest of this suite, adapted for
NBA player props:

- Uses ESPN's public (undocumented, no-key-needed) API, same host family as
  Blitz IQ -- site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/...
- Rebounds and Assists are modeled with POISSON, not Normal -- same
  reasoning as Blitz IQ's WR/TE receptions: these are discrete, low-count
  stats, not a bell-curve shape. RA (rebounds+assists combined) is also
  Poisson -- same idea, just a bigger count.
- Recency-weighted last-7-games average, shrunk toward a league-wide prior
  for small samples -- same small-sample protection as every other tool
  in this suite.

DATA-SOURCE HONESTY NOTE: ESPN's exact gamelog label names for NBA player
stats (whether rebounds is really labeled "REB", assists "AST") are NOT
confirmed against a live response in this build -- only that the gamelog
ENDPOINT itself exists (same host/pattern already proven working for
Blitz IQ's NFL players). This script uses the exact same defensive,
diagnostic-first parsing style Blitz IQ's own gamelog fetcher already
uses for this identical uncertainty: try the assumed label, and if it's
wrong, print a [DIAG] line showing the real labels ESPN actually
returned, rather than silently guessing wrong or crashing.

Setup:
    pip3 install requests --break-system-packages
